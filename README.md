# FireTorchESP
LED effects including an impressive firetorch effect with an ESP8266 and WS2812B

This project combines  
https://www.tweaking4all.com/forums/topic/all-effects-esp8266-with-web-interface/#post-12058
and 
mrks's wonderful arduino driven "Fackelmob"
http://mrks.de/project/Elektrischer_Fackelmob/22, 
adapted for using with the ESP8266

You only need an ESP8266 based mcu, like an NodeMCU, Wemos, ESP12F, an WS2812B LED Stip, (perhaps a levelshifter for getting an better signal)
