# FireTorchESP
LED effects including an impressive firetorch effect with an ESP8266 and WS2812B



This project is the adaption of mrks's wonderful arduino driven "Fackelmob" for using with the ESP8266. http://mrks.de/project/Elektrischer_Fackelmob/22

I intend to make the different light routines changeable throuth mqtt messages.

You only need an ESP8266 based mcu, like an NodeMCU, Wemos, ESP12F, an WS2812B LED Stip, (perhaps a levelshifter for getting an better signal)
